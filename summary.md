# Summary

The goal of the computing will is to establish a flexible framework that performs basic and advanced functions for automated valuable digital transmissions.&#x20;

Our main and first use case is to enable inheritance capabilities of private keys, thus offering one's valuable crypto to be accessed by selected entities in some specified condition.&#x20;

The computing will is built on Ethereum. indeed Ethereum is the most advanced smart contract platform in existence, in addition to being the most utilized one, counting the most developers building of any one platform, and the most advanced wallet infrastructure as well. Therefore the need and build capability are most evident.

The vision is to create a suite of smart contracts, from simple to more advanced, filling the need of different type of wills. The interface shall be simple and purified, while being ideally decentralized.&#x20;
