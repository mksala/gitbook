description: Building a new will framework for a digital world

# Introduction

In a world where most of the value is stored digitally, as it is likely shaping to via cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the paths to be protected are being reimagined as well.&#x20;

Enter the world of digitally decentralized value.

Security is one thing being seriously taken by the industry, as each smart contract or wallet from any serious builder is audited multiple times, while users actively learn the differences between software wallets, hardware wallets, or even smart contract wallets.

Inheritance however, or conditional security, has a lot to catch up with. It is commonly referred to as a "will" in the traditional world, which specifies what should happen in different scenarios of life including death and other major events. Indeed there is not really one robust framework today that we can point you to, in order to achieve such goals in the realm of crypto, in the way of crypto.

It is worth highlighting the difference between a centralized provider such as Google or Facebook, which actually might be able to obey the wish of a traditional will due to being centralized and therefore traditional corporate entities, and decentralized infrastructure such as Ethereum, which obeys only the rules established in its running program and smart contracts.

The decentralized infrastructure, is exactly where we want to build on. As we are in a transition to an age of full computing infrastructure, we need our own humanoid will to catch up to it, and leverage the powerful properties that it features, such as immutability, transparency, and trustless automation.

This is where the name of this project takes shape, the computing will.
