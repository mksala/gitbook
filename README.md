  A decentralized framework for digital legacy planning: give your crypto a
  survivable plan, without trusting a centralized custodian.

# Introduction

Crypto security has matured. Smart contracts get audited, wallets get hardware-hardened, users get more discerning. Legacy planning for crypto has not kept up. Most "solutions" still rely on centralized custodians, legal instruments designed for fiat assets, or a scrap of paper shoved in a safe that nobody remembers where.

**10102 Computing Legacy** is a small, auditable set of Ethereum smart contracts (plus a thin app on top) that lets you define the rules for how your on-chain assets pass on, and executes them automatically when those rules are met. No custody. No subscription required for the core flows. No middleman the plan depends on.

The protocol has been live on Ethereum mainnet since **October 2024** and independently audited twice ([RockSolid Security, report January 2025](https://github.com/10102-io/computing-sc/blob/main/Security_Review_Computing_Will.pdf); [CDSecurity, report October 2025](https://github.com/CDSecurity/audits)). Development started in June 2024; the original contracts repository is [archived and public](https://github.com/10102-labs/computing-sc-og), preserved when the project moved to the `10102-io` GitHub organization in January 2026.

## What it does

- **Transfer legacy**: split specific assets across named Ethereum addresses when you've been inactive for a configurable window. Created from your connected EOA wallet (MetaMask, Ledger, Trezor, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect-compatible mobile wallets).
- **Multisig legacy**: hand over control of an existing Safe to your beneficiaries by adding them as co-signers when the inactivity window elapses. The Safe itself, and everything it holds or governs, _is_ the legacy.
- **Timelock**: a time-based security layer for your own funds: lock assets until a specific date (protecting against coercion, wrench attacks, or your own impulses). Three flavors: Timelock, Soft Timelock, Beneficiary Timelock. For sealed gifts with a claim link, see Heirloom.
- **Premium layer**: optional contingent beneficiaries (fallback layers), authorized watchers (read-only oversight accounts), and email reminders. All additive; the core flows work without them.

## The design principle: your plan survives us

Every feature in this app is operable directly from the Ethereum contracts: without our UI, without our servers, without our company. That's not an afterthought; it's the point.

- **Contracts are verified on Etherscan**. Anyone can call them from any Ethereum interface.
- **Code and audits are public**. See [github.com/10102-io/computing-sc](https://github.com/10102-io/computing-sc) and [github.com/10102-labs/audits](https://github.com/10102-labs/audits).
- **The Legacy Claim Card is printable**. Every legacy produces a one-pager documenting the contract address, legacy ID, and activation instructions, enough for a beneficiary to claim via Etherscan even decades from now. See [Legacy Claim Card](user-guide/legacy/legacy-claim-card.md).
- **Upgrades are timelocked and publicly visible**. The `DefaultProxyAdmin` for all upgradeable contracts is owned by an on-chain upgrade timelock: no implementation can change without first sitting in a public 48-hour queue that anyone can watch. See [Upgrade Policy](architecture/upgrade-policy.md).

If our website goes down tomorrow, your legacy still works. That's the entire bet.

## Built on Ethereum, with the ecosystem

- **Ethereum**: the settlement layer. Mainnet + Sepolia for testing.
- **Safe**: wallet infrastructure for all multisig-based flows (Safe Guard + Safe Module patterns).
- **The Graph**: subgraphs index legacy contracts, token balances, and activity, so the UI stays fast without trusting any single RPC.
- **Mailjet**: transactional email delivery for the off-chain reminder worker. Email scheduling, encryption, and delivery live entirely off-chain; activation itself never depends on it.

## Wallet support

Any wallet that speaks a standard Ethereum connector works: **MetaMask**, **WalletConnect** (covering most mobile wallets), **Coinbase Wallet** (extension, mobile, and passkey-based smart wallets), **Ledger** + **Trezor** (direct or via Ledger Live / Trezor Suite), **Rainbow**, and others. ENS names render everywhere addresses do.

## Mainnet and Sepolia

You can switch networks inside the app. **Sepolia** is the public testnet: identical flow, free test ETH, activation windows configurable in minutes instead of days so you can exercise the whole cycle in a short session. **Mainnet** is production: real assets, real value, real consequences.
