# Concepts

## Legacy type

How your assets pass to your beneficiaries. Two shapes:

- **Transfer legacy**: distributes specific assets to specific addresses when activated, proportional to allocations you set. Created from your connected EOA wallet.
- **Multisig legacy**: hands over your existing Safe by adding your beneficiaries as co-signers on activation. The Safe itself (and everything it holds, stakes, or governs) is the legacy.

## Activation trigger

The condition that makes a legacy claimable. Today there's one trigger: **inactivity**, the time since your last activity the legacy can see (what counts differs by wallet type; see [Heartbeat](#heartbeat)). Measured in days. When the window elapses, any beneficiary can activate.

## Heartbeat

Any action that proves you're still around and resets the activation timer. What counts depends on your wallet type:

- **Safe legacies**: every Safe transaction counts automatically (the Safe Guard records it), so normal usage keeps the legacy fresh.
- **EOA legacies**: interactions with your legacy count (edits, deposits, withdrawals, or the dedicated heartbeat action on the details page). Generic wallet activity elsewhere (a send, a swap) does **not** reset the timer by itself, unless you enable [Auto-renew](#auto-renew-eoa-legacies).

If you don't have another qualifying action to make, the details page has a dedicated heartbeat action that resets the timer in a single transaction.

## Auto-renew (EOA legacies)

An optional Premium feature, off by default, that you enable per legacy. When on, an attestor service watches your wallet's public on-chain activity (its transaction count) and renews your inactivity timer for you when you've been active near the deadline: no email, no click, no gas from you. Every safety bound is enforced on-chain: renewals only work near the deadline, stop 365 days after your last real check-in, and can never make a legacy claimable earlier. See [Automatic Renewal](premium-features/automatic-renewal.md) for the guide, and [EOA Activity & Auto-Renew](../architecture/eoa-activity-auto-renew.md) for the full trust model.

## Creator vs. signer (Safe legacies)

When a Safe creates a legacy, it's the Safe (not an individual) that owns it on-chain. But **the single wallet that submitted the creation transaction** is tagged as the **creator**. On-chain settings (beneficiaries, trigger, allocations) can be changed by any Safe signer at the Safe's threshold. **Off-chain settings** (email reminders, watchers) can only be changed by the creator. This asymmetry is documented inline on the relevant pages.

## Storage token

A substitute for ETH inside the legacy or timelock, because native ETH can't be approved like an ERC-20. When you want to include ETH, you swap it through a built-in route into a supported storage token (WETH, a liquid staking token, etc.) and approve that token instead. You always see the available list in the app.

## CREATE2

The deterministic contract-deployment opcode. We use it so your legacy contract's final address is known _before you sign the deploy transaction_. You can verify it in the app, and beneficiaries can find the contract even if our UI is unavailable. See also [Legacy Claim Card](./legacy/legacy-claim-card.md).

## Safe threshold

The minimum number of Safe signers required to execute a transaction (e.g. 2 of 3). Every on-chain change to a Safe-backed legacy is a Safe transaction and respects your Safe's threshold. You can finalize signatures inside our app or on [app.safe.global](https://app.safe.global); either works.

## Finalizing

When a Safe transaction has collected enough signatures but hasn't executed yet, we call its state _needs finalizing_. Any signer can finalize by paying gas and broadcasting the transaction. Until it's finalized, the change isn't live.

## Watchers

Read-only accounts a Premium user can authorize to view selected legacies under **My Watchlist**. Used for estate lawyers, family oversight, or personal dashboards across wallets. Watchers have one of two visibility levels; see [Manage Authorized Watchers](./premium-features/manage-authorized-watchers.md).

## Contingent beneficiaries

Optional Premium layers. If the primary beneficiaries don't claim within a configurable window after activation, a second-line beneficiary becomes eligible. Same thing for a third-line after a further window. Designed to prevent assets from getting stuck when someone loses keys or is unreachable.

## Legacy Claim Card

A printable one-page summary with the minimum information your beneficiaries need to claim via any Ethereum interface, not just our UI. Contains the legacy ID and contract address; intentionally _excludes_ the owner's address for privacy. See [Legacy Claim Card](./legacy/legacy-claim-card.md).

## Timelock

A self-directed time-based lock on your own assets. Three flavors:

- **Timelock**: locked until a date; then you reclaim.
- **Soft timelock**: locked indefinitely; a waiting period starts when _you_ initiate an unlock.
- **Beneficiary timelock**: locked until a date; then a specified recipient claims. Heirloom wraps this type into a designed gift experience with a claim link and free claiming.

See [Timelock](./timelock/README.md).

## Premium subscription

Optional, time-bound access model (like ENS registrations). Pay upfront in ETH, USDC, or USDT to unlock contingent beneficiaries, watchers, and email reminders for a chosen period. Free users retain full access to legacy creation, editing, and claims.
